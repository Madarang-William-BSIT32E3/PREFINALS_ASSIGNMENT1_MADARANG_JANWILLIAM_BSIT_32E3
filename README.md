Maintainability
Bottlenecks (Encountered)
Have you encountered any challenges with Onion Architecture in your projects?
Answer: Yes

MVC
Components
Model: Represents the data and the business logic
View: Represents the UI elements and user interaction
Controller: Handles the input from the user, processes it, and returns the appropriate view
Bottlenecks (Encountered)

Differences from MVC
Can you differentiate between traditional MVC applications and Web APIs?
Answer: Yes
Briefly explain: Web APIs are designed for handling HTTP requests for data, not necessarily linked to a view, unlike MVC which ties the controllers to views.
Bottlenecks (Encountered)
Have you encountered any performance challenges with traditional MVC applications compared to Web APIs?
Answer: Yes
Briefly explain: Frequent page refreshes causing performance overhead, complex data exchange requiring a more lightweight approach
